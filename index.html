                <p class="about me">My name is Emma Delzer, and I am a web and game developer born and raised in Riverside, California. In May 2016 I earned my Bachelor of Arts with a minor in LGBT Studies from the University of California Berkeley.
                <p>Technology, like other disciplines, is an influential force that has never been neutral in its applications in the world. I believe it is of utmost importance that we question: who controls the flow of information, who is allowed access to information, and who is marginalized within tech, and through tech applications.</br>
                <br>"E pluribus unum."</br></p>
