                <p>My name is Emma Delzer and I am a web and game developer born and raised in Riverside, California. In May 2016 I earned my Bachelor of Arts with a minor in LGBT Studies from the University of California Berkeley.</p>
                <br>I believe that technology is an incredibly influential tool that all tech business owners need to recognize as capable of supporting and harming social equality.
